This system should support indexing for easy searchability and have robust security features.\n\n2. **Standardized Naming Conventions**: Establish and maintain consistent naming conventions for all documents. This helps in organizing and retrieving documents quickly.\n\n3. **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups of the document archive to prevent data loss due to hardware failure, cyber-attacks, or other unforeseen events. Consider using cloud storage solutions for redundancy.\n\n4. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive documents. This helps in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the documents.\n\n5. **Version Control**: Keep track of different versions of documents. This is particularly important for documents that undergo frequent revisions and updates.\n\n6. **Compliance and Legal Retention**: Ensure that your archiving practices comply with relevant laws and regulations regarding document retention. This includes how long certain documents should be kept and how they should be securely disposed of when no longer needed.\n\n7. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of the document archive to ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations. This also helps in identifying and rectifying any issues with the archiving process.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your documents are not only well-preserved but also easily accessible when needed.",

Next, you add the net income from abroad, which is the total income earned by residents from overseas investments and other sources minus the total income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments and other sources. By combining these two components, you get the GNP. In essence, GNP equals GDP plus the net income from abroad. For example, if a country has a GDP of $1,000 billion, and its residents earn $50 billion from abroad while foreign residents earn $30 billion from the country, then the GNP would be $1,020 billion.",
