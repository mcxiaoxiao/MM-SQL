We then filter to only include those template IDs that have a count greater than one.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT Template_ID FROM Documents GROUP BY Template_ID HAVING COUNT(Document_ID) > 1\n```\n\nSubquestion 2: Count the number of unique template IDs identified in Subquestion 1.\n- We simply count the number of rows returned by the query in Subquestion 1, which gives us the number of template IDs used by more than one document.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT Template_ID FROM Documents GROUP BY Template_ID HAVING COUNT(Document_ID) > 1)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that we only consider template IDs that are associated with more than one document, and we count how many such template IDs exist."

Otherwise, they did not.\n\nSince the SQL query in Subquestion 1 will directly give us the count of distinct graduation dates, we can infer the answer to the question based on whether this count is 15 or not. \n\nQuestion Solved."

Next, you add the net income from abroad, which is the total income earned by residents from overseas investments and other sources minus the total income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments and other sources. By combining these two components, you get the GNP. In essence, GNP equals GDP plus the net income from abroad.

This is a straightforward modification to the previous SQL query. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Required Columns**: The question asks for the average ranking, first name, and last name of each player.\n\n2. **Determine the Tables and Joins Needed**: We need to join the `players` table with the `rankings` table to get the ranking information for each player.\n\n3. **Group By Clause**: We need to group by the player to calculate the average ranking for each player.\n\n4. **Select the Columns in the Correct Order**: The order of columns in the `SELECT` statement should match the order they are mentioned in the question: average ranking, first name, and last name.\n\nNow, let's write the SQL query:\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(T2.ranking), T1.first_name, T1.last_name \nFROM players AS T1 \nJOIN rankings AS T2 ON T1.player_id = T2.player_id \nGROUP BY T1.player_id\n```\n\nThis query calculates the average ranking for each player and includes both their first and last names, as requested. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the average is calculated for each player individually."

We will filter for left-handed players and group by player ID to get the average ranking.\n\nSubquestion 3: Combine the results to show the last names of left-handed players along with their average rankings.\n- We will combine the results from Subquestion 1 and Subquestion 2 to get the desired output.\n\nFinal SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT T1.last_name, AVG(T2.ranking) AS avg_ranking\nFROM players AS T1\nJOIN rankings AS T2 ON T1.player_id = T2.player_id\nWHERE T1.hand = \"L\"\nGROUP BY T1.player_id;\n```\n\nThis query selects the last names of left-handed players and calculates their average rankings by joining the `players` and `rankings` tables, filtering for players with a hand value of \"L\", and grouping by player ID."

Therefore, we will decompose the question into subquestions based on this assumption:\n\nSubquestion 1: Identify students who are currently enrolled and will be enrolled in the next five years.\n- We need to filter students who have a `date_left` that is either in the future or null, indicating they are still enrolled.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT student_id FROM Students WHERE date_left IS NULL OR date_left > DATE('now')\n```\n\nSubquestion 2: Count the number of courses each of these students is enrolled in.\n- We will join the `Students`, `Student_Enrolment`, and `Student_Enrolment_Courses` tables to count the number of courses for each student.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT T1.student_id, COUNT(T3.course_id) AS course_count\nFROM Students AS T1\nJOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.student_id = T2.student_id\nJOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses AS T3 ON T2.student_enrolment_id = T3.student_enrolment_id\nWHERE T1.date_left IS NULL OR T1.date_left > DATE('now')\nGROUP BY T1.student_id\n```\n\nSubquestion 3: Determine the student with the highest number of course enrollments.\n- We will order the results from Subquestion 2 by `course_count` in descending order and select the top result.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT T1.first_name, T1.last_name\nFROM Students AS T1\nJOIN (\n    SELECT T2.student_id, COUNT(T3.course_id) AS course_count\n    FROM Student_Enrolment AS T2\n    JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses AS T3 ON T2.student_enrolment_id = T3.student_enrolment_id\n    WHERE T2.student_id IN (\n        SELECT student_id FROM Students WHERE date_left IS NULL OR date_left > DATE('now')\n    )\n    GROUP BY T2.student_id\n    ORDER BY course_count DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) AS MostSuccessful ON T1.student_id = MostSuccessful.student_id\n```\n\nThis final SQL query will provide the name of the student who is currently enrolled and has the highest number of course enrollments, assuming this is a measure of success."

Neither of these tables explicitly contains a column that suggests information about who recorded the transcript. The columns in `Transcripts` are `transcript_id`, `transcript_date`, and `other_details`, while `Transcript_Contents` contains `student_course_id` and `transcript_id`.\n\nSince there is no direct column indicating who recorded the transcript, we can conclude that the current schema does not provide this information.

Let's decompose the question into subquestions and generate the SQL step-by-step:\n\nSubquestion 1: Identify the models with a weight greater than 3500.\n- We need to select models from the `cars_data` table where the `Weight` column is greater than 3500.\n- We will join the `cars_data` table with the `car_names` table to get the model names.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.Model \nFROM cars_data AS T1 \nJOIN car_names AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.MakeId \nWHERE T1.Weight > 3500\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct model names from the `car_names` table where the corresponding car data in the `cars_data` table has a weight greater than 3500. The join between `cars_data` and `car_names` is necessary to map the car data to their respective model names."

This information is derived from the previous QA.\n\n2. **Find museums visited before 2009**: Once we have identified the visitor, we need to find out which museums this visitor visited that were opened before 2009.\n\nLet's break this down into subquestions:\n\n### Subquestion 1: Identify the visitor who visited both a museum opened before 2009 and a museum opened after 2011.\nWe can use the result from the previous QA to identify the visitor. The SQL query from the previous QA is:\n```sql\nSELECT t1.visitor_ID \nFROM visit AS t1 \nJOIN museum AS t2 ON t2.Museum_ID = t1.Museum_ID \nWHERE t2.Open_Year < 2009 \nINTERSECT \nSELECT t1.visitor_ID \nFROM visit AS t1 \nJOIN museum AS t2 ON t2.Museum_ID = t1.Museum_ID \nWHERE t2.Open_Year > 2011\n```\n\n### Subquestion 2: Find the museums visited by this visitor before 2009.\nNow that we have the visitor ID, we need to find the museums they visited that were opened before 2009. We will use the visitor ID obtained from Subquestion 1.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT t2.Name \nFROM visit AS t1 \nJOIN museum AS t2 ON t2.Museum_ID = t1.Museum_ID \nWHERE t1.visitor_ID IN (\n    SELECT t1.visitor_ID \n    FROM visit AS t1 \n    JOIN museum AS t2 ON t2.Museum_ID = t1.Museum_ID \n    WHERE t2.Open_Year < 2009 \n    INTERSECT \n    SELECT t1.visitor_ID \n    FROM visit AS t1 \n    JOIN museum AS t2 ON t2.Museum_ID = t1.Museum_ID \n    WHERE t2.Open_Year > 2011\n) \nAND t2.Open_Year < 2009\n```\n\nThis query will give us the names of the museums visited by the identified visitor before 2009."

Let's break this down into subquestions:\n\nSubquestion 1: Identify cities where there are employees aged 29 or older.\nSQL ```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT City FROM employee WHERE Age >= 29\n```\n\nSubquestion 2: Identify cities where all employees are under age 29 by excluding cities found in Subquestion 1.\nSQL ```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT City FROM employee WHERE City NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT City FROM employee WHERE Age >= 29)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that we only select cities where every employee is under the age of 29, adhering to the constraints provided."

The goal is to identify the winner who has the highest number of wins and then retrieve their name and rank points. Here are the steps:\n\nSubquestion 1: Determine the winner who has won the most matches.\n- We need to count the number of matches each winner has won and identify the winner with the maximum count.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT winner_name, COUNT(*) AS win_count \nFROM matches \nGROUP BY winner_name \nORDER BY win_count DESC \nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nSubquestion 2: Retrieve the name and rank points of the winner identified in Subquestion 1.\n- Using the result from Subquestion 1, we will fetch the winner's name and rank points.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT winner_name, winner_rank_points \nFROM matches \nWHERE winner_name = (\n    SELECT winner_name \n    FROM matches \n    GROUP BY winner_name \n    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC \n    LIMIT 1\n)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we first identify the winner with the most wins and then retrieve the necessary details about that winner, adhering to the constraints provided."

Based on the schema, \"W\" likely refers to \"Weight\" from the `cars_data` table, and \"1\" could refer to an identifier, possibly a `ModelId` or `MakeId`. However, without explicit context, we need to make an assumption based on the schema structure.\n\nAssuming \"1\" refers to a `ModelId` or `MakeId`, we need to find the corresponding weight from the `cars_data` table. However, the `cars_data` table does not have a direct link to `ModelId` or `MakeId`. Therefore, we need to trace through the relationships in the schema to find the correct linkage.\n\nLet's decompose the question into subquestions:\n\nSubquestion 1: Determine the relationship between `ModelId` or `MakeId` and `Weight`.\n- Since `cars_data` only contains `Weight`, we need to find a way to link `Weight` to either `ModelId` or `MakeId`. However, the schema does not provide a direct link. We need to assume that the question might be incomplete or requires additional context not provided in the schema.\n\nSubquestion 2: Assuming \"1\" refers to a `ModelId`, find the corresponding `Weight`.\n- Since there is no direct link between `ModelId` and `Weight`, we cannot directly query this without additional context or assumptions.\n\nSubquestion 3: Assuming \"1\" refers to a `MakeId`, find the corresponding `Weight`.\n- Again, there is no direct link between `MakeId` and `Weight` in the provided schema.\n\nGiven the lack of direct relationships in the schema, we cannot generate a valid SQL query without making assumptions that go beyond the provided schema. If additional context or schema details are available, they would be necessary to proceed further. \n\nIn conclusion, the question cannot be answered with the current schema and context provided. Further clarification or additional schema details are needed to generate a valid SQL query."

This query joins `model_list` with `car_makers` and `countries` to filter models by the country \"USA\".\n- We need to modify this query to select the makers (companies) instead of model counts.\n\n### SQL for Subquestion 1:\nSQL ```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.FullName \nFROM model_list AS T1 \nJOIN car_makers AS T2 ON T1.Maker = T2.Id \nJOIN countries AS T3 ON T2.Country = T3.CountryId \nWHERE T3.CountryName = 'usa'\n```\n\n- **Explanation**: \n  - We select `DISTINCT T2.FullName` to ensure we get unique company names, as multiple models might be associated with the same company.\n  - The joins between `model_list`, `car_makers`, and `countries` are necessary as they filter and map model entries to their respective companies and country of production.\n  - The `WHERE` clause ensures we're only looking at models related to the USA.\n\nThis query effectively answers the question by listing the companies (makers) that produce car models in the USA."

This involves looking up the 'flights' table for any entries with 'SourceAirport' as 'APG'.\n   \n2. **Count the number of distinct airlines identified in the previous step.**\n   - Once we have the list of distinct airlines, we will count these entries to determine how many airlines have such flights.\n\nHere are the subquestions and their corresponding SQL queries:\n\n**Subquestion 1:** Identify distinct airlines that have flights departing from APG.\n- SQL:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT DISTINCT T1.Airline FROM flights AS T1 WHERE T1.SourceAirport = 'APG'\n  ```\n\n**Subquestion 2:** Count the number of distinct airlines operating from APG.\n- SQL:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.Airline) FROM flights AS T1 WHERE T1.SourceAirport = 'APG'\n  ```\n\nThe first query identifies all distinct airlines that have flights departing from the airport with code 'APG'. The second query counts the number of those distinct airlines, which provides the answer to the current question. \n\nThe problem is solved efficiently and adheres to the constraints provided, ensuring that only necessary tables and columns are accessed."
