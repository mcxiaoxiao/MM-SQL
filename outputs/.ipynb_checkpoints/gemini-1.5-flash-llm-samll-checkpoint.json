Next, you add the net income from abroad, which is the total income earned by residents from overseas investments and other sources minus the total income earned by foreign residents from domestic investments and other sources. By combining these two components, you get the GNP. In essence, GNP equals GDP plus the net income from abroad. For example, if a country has a GDP of $1,000 billion, and its residents earn $50 billion from abroad while foreign residents earn $30 billion from the country, then the GNP would be $1,020 billion.",
