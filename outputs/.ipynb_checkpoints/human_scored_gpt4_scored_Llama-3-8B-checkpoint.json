Clarity: 1 point - The response is mostly clear, but it could be confusing since it does not specify that the country names will be grouped by continent. Completeness: 1 point - The response does not thoroughly address the user's question about listing names on each continent; it only provides a list of country names without the context of continents. Accuracy: 2 points - The SQL query is accurate in terms of syntax and logic for retrieving country names. Utility: 1 point - The response somewhat meets the user's needs by providing a SQL query, but it does not clarify the relationship between countries and continents effectively.
