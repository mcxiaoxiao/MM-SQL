It's a simple and straightforward sentence.\nCompleteness: 0 - The response does not address the question at all. It ignores the user's 'Thanks!' and instead tries to initiate a new interaction.\nAccuracy: 2 - Not applicable.\nUtility: 0 - The response does not meet the user's needs. The user simply wanted to express gratitude, and the system's response is not helpful in that regard."
