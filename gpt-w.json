This relationship allows us to join these tables.\n\n3. **Decompose the Question into Subquestions**:\n   - Subquestion 1: Count the number of car models for each maker.\n   - Subquestion 2: Retrieve the full name of each maker and the count of models.\n\n4. **Generate SQL for Each Subquestion**:\n\n   **Subquestion 1**: Count the number of car models for each maker.\n   - SQL: \n     ```sql\n     SELECT Maker, COUNT(ModelId) AS model_count FROM model_list GROUP BY Maker\n     ```\n\n   **Subquestion 2**: Retrieve the full name of each maker and the count of models.\n   - SQL:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT T2.FullName, COUNT(T1.ModelId) AS model_count\n     FROM model_list AS T1\n     INNER JOIN car_makers AS T2 ON T1.Maker = T2.Id\n     GROUP BY T2.FullName\n     ```\n\nThis SQL query will provide the count of car models produced by each maker along with the maker's full name.

This involves counting the number of template IDs that appear more than once in the `Documents` table. Let's break this down into subquestions:\n\nSubquestion 1: Identify the template IDs that are used by more than one document.\n- We need to group the documents by `Template_ID` and count the number of documents for each template. We then filter to only include those template IDs that have a count greater than one.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT Template_ID FROM Documents GROUP BY Template_ID HAVING COUNT(Document_ID) > 1\n```\n\nSubquestion 2: Count the number of unique template IDs identified in Subquestion 1.\n- We simply count the number of rows returned by the query in Subquestion 1, which gives us the number of template IDs used by more than one document.\n\nSQL:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT Template_ID FROM Documents GROUP BY Template_ID HAVING COUNT(Document_ID) > 1)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that we only consider template IDs that are associated with more than one document, and we count how many such template IDs exist."
